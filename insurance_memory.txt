Hi Ishani,_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Apologies if you’ve been able to get hold of me, I can only see the missed call from last night but I was in meetings as well yesterday so you wouldn’t have been able to get me on the landline._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I’ve sent an urgent chaser to underwriters to resolve, I can see I passed them your details to issue a log in at the time of renewal and this should have been actioned their end but may have been missed, I’ve requested they get onto this asap._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
In the meantime the motor certificate (attached) shows the terms of insurance so I’d recommend keeping this with vehicles as evidence of cover if required._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I’ll come back to you as soon as I have underwriters response._x000D_

I tried to reach you without much success._x000D_
_x000D_

I’m unable to add a new vehicle to the MIB portal since the new policy dates are not updates.  Please can you look-in to this and update me urgently._x000D_
_x000D_

I already added the new vehicle registration number LK25UWP to the list but not sure whether it’s added since the dates are not showing on the portal._x000D_

Hi Ishani,_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Apologies if you’ve been able to get hold of me, I can only see the missed call from last night but I was in meetings as well yesterday so you wouldn’t have been able to get me on the landline._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I’ve sent an urgent chaser to underwriters to resolve, I can see I passed them your details to issue a log in at the time of renewal and this should have been actioned their end but may have been missed, I’ve requested they get onto this asap._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
In the meantime the motor certificate (attached) shows the terms of insurance so I’d recommend keeping this with vehicles as evidence of cover if required._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I’ll come back to you as soon as I have underwriters response._x000D_

The Goods In Transit doesn’t have a certificate attached to it but please see attached for a copy of the policy document._x000D_
