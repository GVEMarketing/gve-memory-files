Subject: Appeal Against Late Filing Penalty – GVE Exports Ltd (Company No. 14532992_x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
Dear Sir/Madam,_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I am writing to formally appeal the late filing penalty of £375 imposed on GVE Exports Ltd for the financial year ending November 2023. The accounts were filed on 15 April 2025, beyond the deadline of 28 February 2025._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The delay was due to an internal financial fraud that came to light during the preparation of our accounts. This unforeseen event necessitated a thorough investigation, significantly impacting our ability to finalize the accounts on time. The situation also adversely affected the company's financial stability, leading to ongoing financial hardship._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Given these exceptional circumstances, I kindly request that you consider waiving the penalty. We are extremely apologetic and are committed to compliance and have taken steps to prevent such delays in the future._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Should you require any further information, do not hesitate to contact me._x000D_
