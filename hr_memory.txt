		Hi Abbey,_x000D_
_x000D_
		 _x000D_
_x000D_
		This is getting quite unprofessional now. It has been three months since the exhaust was first requested to be returned. We returned the unit to you under the agreement we would be refunded in full as we purchased another unit from you. _x000D_
_x000D_
		 _x000D_
_x000D_
		I have requested a response on this countless times and have been told over the phone that the unit has been received and I would hear back from you. I am not sure why it has taken this long to review the unit and issue a refund to us? _x000D_
_x000D_
		 _x000D_
_x000D_
		Please forward confirmation of the refund set up before this needs to be actioned further. _x000D_
_x000D_
		 _x000D_
_x000D_
		I have received 15 emails form @Steve Kilcoyne <mailto:steve@topgear.co.uk>  about the various TopGear products in the elapsed time since the refund request, none of which relates to the issue we have currently, so I am not sure why no one has communicated to update me on what is going on._x000D_

Good afternoon Ishani,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I hope this email finds you well and you don’t mind me getting in touch, we were in discussions with your colleague, Rebecca, in the past however I believe she is no longer with the business, regarding your hiring of technicians,  panel beaters and spray painters._x000D_
_x000D_
I wanted to introduce myself and MCK Global as a business, we help companies like Auto Inspire with your recruitment of Technicians and have specialised in International Recruitment for the past 13 years, placing candidates across the UK, Ireland and Canada. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
As a business we focus on overseas recruitment as typically the local market can be very difficult to source, with poor quality candidates that are on a merry go round for higher wages. The candidates we have placed are of a very high quality, both in terms of work standards and loyalty to the firm. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I have attached a brochure of how we look to work with businesses like yours. We currently work with Arnold Clark, Peter Vardy, TrustFord, amongst others, and are very comfortable working alongside internal recruitment teams. We are very trusted in this space and have great feedback from the above companies, leading to a 96% retention rate for our candidates. Lots of companies are concerned around the extra work required for Visa sponsorship etc, however we take all of the heavy lifting off of you as a business to allow you to concentrate on the important matters._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
If you would like a bit more detail, let me know and we can set up a quick meeting as I feel there would be great scope to work together to fill any current or future vacancies._x000D_
_x000D_
I look forward to catching up in due course._x000D_

Hello _x000D_
_x000D_
A new YouGov survey <https://acasnational.cmail19.com/t/r-l-thkreuk-nukuduutrl-y/> , commissioned by Acas, asked employees to consider what would make them the most angry while at work._x000D_
_x000D_
Nearly half (49%) of employees said that people that are perceived not to be doing their job properly is the thing that makes them angriest at work._x000D_
_x000D_
Acas Head of Individual Dispute Resolution, Stewart Gee, said: "Unresolved emotions over things that seem unfair can have a detrimental effect at work and it is important for workplace conflict <https://acasnational.cmail19.com/t/r-l-thkreuk-nukuduutrl-j/>  to be addressed at the earliest possible opportunity._x000D_
_x000D_
"An informal resolution <https://acasnational.cmail19.com/t/r-l-thkreuk-nukuduutrl-t/>  through an initial chat or mediation can help organisations prevent the cost and stress of more formal procedures, such as an employment tribunal."_x000D_
_x000D_

Subject: Probation Review Form- Russell Knight_x000D_
I am reaching out to guide you through the probation review process. The process is critical in assessing the employee’s progress and ensuring that they meet the expectations of their role during their probationary period. Below are the steps and details for filling out the Probation Review Form, which includes the (Initial Meeting, 3-month review, and 6 or 9-month final review)._x000D_
• Section A: Objectives_x000D_
In this part, you need to identify specific objectives for Russell. These should reflect the core duties of his role as an Apprentice Technician and any skills he should develop during the probationary period. The objectives should include clear success indicators and timescales for achieving them. For example:_x000D_
• Section B: Development Plan_x000D_
Here, outline any training or development needs that Russell might require to meet these objectives. If there are any workshops or training opportunities that can support him, these should be listed. For example:_x000D_
The 3-month review assesses Russell’s performance in the following key areas:_x000D_
• Quality and accuracy of work: Has Russell demonstrated the ability to complete tasks correctly and efficiently?_x000D_
• Efficiency: Is he able to complete tasks within reasonable timeframes without compromising quality?_x000D_
• Attendance: Has he maintained a consistent attendance record?_x000D_
• Timekeeping: Is he punctual and reliable?_x000D_
• Work relationships: How well does he communicate and collaborate with the team?_x000D_
• Competency in the role: Is Russell competent in the tasks he is assigned, and is he gaining the necessary technical knowledge?_x000D_
If there are any areas of concern, please provide specific details. For example:_x000D_
• If Russell is struggling with technical tasks, you might suggest more hands-on support or additional training._x000D_
The Final Review should be completed at the end of the 6 or 9-month probation period. In this review, the same performance areas from the 3-month review will be assessed once again. Here’s what to focus on:_x000D_
• Have the objectives identified (in the initial meeting Part 1) for the probationary period been met?_x000D_
• Have the training and development needs been addressed?_x000D_
In this section, you will also provide an overall summary of Russell’s performance and progress over the probation period. Based on the information gathered, you must decide:_x000D_
• Is the employee’s appointment to be confirmed?_x000D_
• Should the employee’s probationary period be extended?_x000D_
• After completing the probation review form, please send a copy to HR if there are any issues such as extension requests or concerns during the probation period. HR will issue a letter to confirm the completion of the probation period or to acknowledge the extension._x000D_

			For optimal performance, we recommend using a PC that meets the current requirements for running Windows 11. This includes an Intel Core i5 (or equivalent AMD Ryzen) processor, 8GB of RAM, and either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome installed. This is a recommended specification. While the product can run on lower-spec PCs, we cannot guarantee the same level of performance or product quality. _x000D_
