Hi both, _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_

I’ve just informed by LPC that Lawgistics have been sent the summary of the Judgement. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Can you please urgently send it on to me so we can proceed with the Insurance claim. _x000D_

David,_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Apologies for the late email. I wanted to respond before my annual leave. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
If payment is not made by the deadline, you are at risk of the claimant enforcing the judgment and you will then have a CCJ on your records and potentially more costs. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
It is possible to agree an extension with the other side, but they may still press the button when payment is not received in the original timescale and so any extension request (which may be denied, in any event) should be clear that the claimant agrees to wait until X date to receive funds and will not request that a CCJ is entered before then. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Are you not able to make payment and claim it back from insurance afterwards? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_

Also Joshua advised to let the other side know that we are currently going through insurance to cover the cost of the claim. So that, if we got closer to the date and insurance still haven’t paid out then we could try to request another 14 days to pay. _x000D_

We can ask, but I am unsure whether such would incur an additional cost or not. _x000D_

@Litigation <mailto:litigation@lawgistics.co.uk>  can we please contact LPC to request that the representative summarises his attendance note? Please confirm if there would be a cost to this. Counsel is not opposed to this but requires LPC to direct him. _x000D_

Hi Ishani_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Everything is in the attendance note including the amounts the court ordered GVE to pay (top of the attendance note).  _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Essentially, the judge decided that GVE had a duty to look after the vehicle and concluded that it did not and found the other side’s evidence to be more compelling. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I am surprised the £3,000 drop hands offer was not accepted, especially given that GVE previously offered £4,500 and £11,500. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Disappointing outcome but it was always 50/50 as neither side could prove or disprove when the damage happened. _x000D_

Please can you provide a summary of the recent court judgment in relation to this case outlying that the court has concluded that GVE was negligent in this matter and has ruled in favor of the claimant and as a result, GVE has been ordered to pay the full amount of the claim. _x000D_

We would appreciate it if you could assist us in communicating this ruling to our insurance company, as it directly impacts the settlement of the claim. _x000D_

Apologies for the late email. I wanted to respond before my annual leave. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
If payment is not made by the deadline, you are at risk of the claimant enforcing the judgment and you will then have a CCJ on your records and potentially more costs. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
It is possible to agree an extension with the other side, but they may still press the button when payment is not received in the original timescale and so any extension request (which may be denied, in any event) should be clear that the claimant agrees to wait until X date to receive funds and will not request that a CCJ is entered before then. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Are you not able to make payment and claim it back from insurance afterwards? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_

Also Joshua advised to let the other side know that we are currently going through insurance to cover the cost of the claim. So that, if we got closer to the date and insurance still haven’t paid out then we could try to request another 14 days to pay. _x000D_

We can ask, but I am unsure whether such would incur an additional cost or not. _x000D_

_x000D_
@Litigation <mailto:litigation@lawgistics.co.uk>  can we please contact LPC to request that the representative summarises his attendance note? Please confirm if there would be a cost to this. Counsel is not opposed to this but requires LPC to direct him. _x000D_

Hi Ishani_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Everything is in the attendance note including the amounts the court ordered GVE to pay (top of the attendance note).  _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Essentially, the judge decided that GVE had a duty to look after the vehicle and concluded that it did not and found the other side’s evidence to be more compelling. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I am surprised the £3,000 drop hands offer was not accepted, especially given that GVE previously offered £4,500 and £11,500. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Disappointing outcome but it was always 50/50 as neither side could prove or disprove when the damage happened. _x000D_

Please can you provide a summary of the recent court judgment in relation to this case outlying that the court has concluded that GVE was negligent in this matter and has ruled in favor of the claimant and as a result, GVE has been ordered to pay the full amount of the claim. _x000D_

Dear Claire_x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
I am advised that a further payment in the sum of £5,000 has been made and the remainder of the balance will be settled by 09 May 2025. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Our client is not shying away from making payment, at all, and such is illustrated by the £10,000 already paid.  _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Our client would be grateful if your client allows the three week grace period, until 09 May, as the full settlement will be paid before any enforcement action would begin, in any event. _x000D_

Good Morning _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We acknowledge payment of £5,000 towards the judgment in this matter. Please can you confirm what it is that is being resolved between your client and their insurer? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The judgment was for £22,174.27 and was to be paid by 17 April 2025. Please confirm when we can expect payment of the full balance? I am unsure why our client should agree to wait whilst your client and their insurer resolve anything between themselves? Surely payment should be made to our client and then whatever issues need to be resolved with your client can be done so after?  _x000D_
_x000D_

Thank you for your email. _x000D_

The Claimant’s solicitor has confirmed that it agrees to the request for a further 14-day extension for the filing of the Defence, which is now due by 4pm on 3 June 2025._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The Claimant solicitor has however also been contacted by DWF, who also still seem to be acting for GVE. I’ve contacted DWF and the insurer in an effort to clarify the position and should hear from both tomorrow. The main point however is that we now have the above extension. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
If we are confirmed as acting for GVE then I will ask DWF for a copy of their file, however it would still be very useful to have the below points clarified and to speak with Aaron. _x000D_

Yes, that is what my understanding was that we were going to ask for an extension. There’s a colleague of mine who was actually assisting with this and she has contracted chickenpox.

Dear Mr Rai_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Further to our telephone conversations of a few weeks ago; I understand from the legal expenses’ insurer that DWF, that had been acting for GVE, has been dis-instructed and that this firm will now be acting for GVE in respect of the claim brought by Mr Hughes._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I telephoned this morning and spoke briefly with George, who is copied to this email, and he has authorised my seeking an extension of time for the filing of the Defence. The maximum period is a further 14-days which would make the Defence due by 4pm on 3 June 2025. I have therefore sent an email to the Claimant’s solicitor asking for a further 14-days in which to file the Defence. The Claimant’s solicitor has previously stated that Mr Hughes would not be willing to grant any further extension. If he does not agree the only option will be to make an application to the court asking that the court grant the extension. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I’d set out in the email below the main points of dispute in the case, and it would be very helpful to get GVE’s position on the below. I understand that Aaron is still the sales manager and it would be very useful to be able to speak with him regarding his recollection of the sale. I’d also be grateful if you could provide any relevant documents that you have, although I will in any event be asking DWF to supply a copy of their file. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I look forward to hearing from you._x000D_

Further to the below email. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I calculate that the Defence will be due to be filed at court by 4pm 6 May 25. As noted below a Defendant can seek an extension of this time of up to 28-days. I would therefore advise in the strongest terms that such an extension is sought from the Claimant’s solicitor as a matter of the utmost urgency. If GVE fails to obtain an extension and also fails to file a Defence then the Claimant Mr Hughes will be able to obtain what is termed a Judgment in Default for the sum he has claimed, and will then be able to enforce the judgment against GVE. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I have also now had an opportunity to consider the Claimant’s case as set out in the Particulars of Claim. The main allegations appear to be as set out below:_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_

5.	There are a number of defects with the van, including the air bags, exhaust, brakes and wheel clearance.  _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The Claimant is seeking to reject the van and to recover his purchase money from GVE. In respect of the alleged misrepresentations it can be a defence where the person making the representation can show that he/she had reasonable grounds for the statement. In addition a buyer will need to show that he has relied on the statement, so if Mr Hughes did inspect the engine before taking possession that will potentially undermine that allegation regarding whether the van is indeed an R32. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
However the discrepancy between the odometer reading and that shown in the various MOT tests will need to be explained as the evidence seems to show clear tampering with the mileage. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I would again stress the urgency of seeking an extension of the time in which to file a defence. I would be grateful if we could discuss the above, perhaps later this afternoon. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
I calculate that the Defence will be due to be filed with the court by 4pm 6 May 2025. However, the court rules allow the parties to agree an extension of the time for the filing of a defence by a period of up to 28-days. The defence would not then be due until 3 June 25. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I note that attached to the Particulars of Claim is a letter from Stormcatcher, who I assume was acting for Mr Hughes up to the issue of proceedings. The claim form however provides an address for service as Newtons Solicitors. I would suggest that I contact Newtons and ask for the above extension on behalf of GVE._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_

Can you also advise when would be convenient to discuss the claim against GVE. _x000D_

As we discussed, the service of the claim form was on 8 April 25, together with the Particulars of Claim, meant that as the Defendant GVE had a period of 14-days in which to file an acknowledgement of service with the court. I understand that the acknowledgement of service has indeed been filed with the court. As such GVE now has 28 days from 8 April to file a Defence to the claim with the Court. _x000D_

I have attached the Particulars of Claim which set out the detailed allegations made by the Claimant. I’d be grateful if you could consider the allegations set out therein, and if we can arrange to discuss this next week, perhaps Monday or Tuesday afternoon, if either is convenient for you. _x000D_

In addition a buyer will need to show that he has relied on the statement, so if Mr Hughes did inspect the engine before taking possession that will potentially undermine that allegation regarding whether the van is indeed an R32. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
However the discrepancy between the odometer reading and that shown in the various MOT tests will need to be explained as the evidence seems to show clear tampering with the mileage. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I would again stress the urgency of seeking an extension of the time in which to file a defence. I would be grateful if we could discuss the above, perhaps later this afternoon. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I look forward to hearing from you._x000D_

Dear Mr Rai_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I hope you have safely received my below email._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I calculate that the Defence will be due to be filed with the court by 4pm 6 May 2025. However, the court rules allow the parties to agree an extension of the time for the filing of a defence by a period of up to 28-days. The defence would not then be due until 3 June 25. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I note that attached to the Particulars of Claim is a letter from Stormcatcher, who I assume was acting for Mr Hughes up to the issue of proceedings. The claim form however provides an address for service as Newtons Solicitors. I would suggest that I contact Newtons and ask for the above extension on behalf of GVE._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Can you also advise when would be convenient to discuss the claim against GVE. _x000D_

Dear Mr Rai_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for your time earlier on the telephone. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
As we discussed, the service of the claim form was on 8 April 25, together with the Particulars of Claim, meant that as the Defendant GVE had a period of 14-days in which to file an acknowledgement of service with the court. I understand that the acknowledgement of service has indeed been filed with the court. As such GVE now has 28 days from 8 April to file a Defence to the claim with the Court. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I have attached the Particulars of Claim which set out the detailed allegations made by the Claimant. I’d be grateful if you could consider the allegations set out therein, and if we can arrange to discuss this next week, perhaps Monday or Tuesday afternoon, if either is convenient for you. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I see that the Particulars of Claim were drafted by a barrister and so I would expect Mr Hughes to have also instructed a solicitor, and if he has then please provide their contact details. _x000D_

We acknowledge payment of £5,000 towards the judgment in this matter. Please can you confirm what it is that is being resolved between your client and their insurer? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The judgment was for £22,174.27 and was to be paid by 17 April 2025. Please confirm when we can expect payment of the full balance? I am unsure why our client should agree to wait whilst your client and their insurer resolve anything between themselves? Surely payment should be made to our client and then whatever issues need to be resolved with your client can be done so after?  _x000D_

_x000D_
They are ready to make the first £5,000 towards the amount outstanding and will make another £5,000 payment next week if the insurance does not resolve the matter by then.  _x000D_

Good Morning _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We acknowledge payment of £5,000 towards the judgment in this matter. Please can you confirm what it is that is being resolved between your client and their insurer? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The judgment was for £22,174.27 and was to be paid by 17 April 2025. Please confirm when we can expect payment of the full balance? I am unsure why our client should agree to wait whilst your client and their insurer resolve anything between themselves? Surely payment should be made to our client and then whatever issues need to be resolved with your client can be done so after?  _x000D_

Good Morning _x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
We acknowledge payment of £5,000 towards the judgment in this matter. Please can you confirm what it is that is being resolved between your client and their insurer? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The judgment was for £22,174.27 and was to be paid by 17 April 2025. Please confirm when we can expect payment of the full balance? I am unsure why our client should agree to wait whilst your client and their insurer resolve anything between themselves? Surely payment should be made to our client and then whatever issues need to be resolved with your client can be done so after?  _x000D_

Good Morning _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We acknowledge payment of £5,000 towards the judgment in this matter. Please can you confirm what it is that is being resolved between your client and their insurer? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The judgment was for £22,174.27 and was to be paid by 17 April 2025. Please confirm when we can expect payment of the full balance? I am unsure why our client should agree to wait whilst your client and their insurer resolve anything between themselves? Surely payment should be made to our client and then whatever issues need to be resolved with your client can be done so after?  _x000D_

We acknowledge payment of £5,000 towards the judgment in this matter. Please can you confirm what it is that is being resolved between your client and their insurer? _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The judgment was for £22,174.27 and was to be paid by 17 April 2025. Please confirm when we can expect payment of the full balance? I am unsure why our client should agree to wait whilst your client and their insurer resolve anything between themselves? Surely payment should be made to our client and then whatever issues need to be resolved with your client can be done so after?  _x000D_
