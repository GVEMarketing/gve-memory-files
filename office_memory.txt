I don’t understand why this is such an issue._x000D_

					Hi Omar , _x000D_
_x000D_
					I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
					I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
					Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
					As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
					Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

_x000D_

_x000D_
					I’m incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of the team – everyone has been genuinely welcoming and supportive, and I truly appreciate it._x000D_
_x000D_
					Although I’ve come to realise that the position isn’t quite the right fit for me, I want to thank you all for your kindness and encouragement during my time with you. I wish you all the very best in your continued success._x000D_
_x000D_
					If it’s possible to be paid for the days I attended, I’d be very grateful. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if there’s anything further you need from me._x000D_

					Hi Omar , _x000D_
_x000D_
					I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
					I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
					Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
					As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
					Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

					Hi Omar , _x000D_
_x000D_
					I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
					I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
					Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
					As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
					Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

_x000D_

					I’m incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of the team – everyone has been genuinely welcoming and supportive, and I truly appreciate it._x000D_

					Although I’ve come to realise that the position isn’t quite the right fit for me, I want to thank you all for your kindness and encouragement during my time with you. I wish you all the very best in your continued success._x000D_
_x000D_
					If it’s possible to be paid for the days I attended, I’d be very grateful. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if there’s anything further you need from me._x000D_

_x000D_
					I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
					I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
					Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
					As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
					Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

_x000D_
					I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
					I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
					Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
					As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_

					I’m incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of the team – everyone has been genuinely welcoming and supportive, and I truly appreciate it._x000D_

					Although I’ve come to realise that the position isn’t quite the right fit for me, I want to thank you all for your kindness and encouragement during my time with you. I wish you all the very best in your continued success._x000D_
_x000D_
					If it’s possible to be paid for the days I attended, I’d be very grateful. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if there’s anything further you need from me._x000D_

_x000D_
					I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
					I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
					Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
					As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
					Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

					Hi Omar , _x000D_
_x000D_
					I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
					I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
					Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
					As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
					Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

_x000D_

_x000D_
					I’m incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of the team – everyone has been genuinely welcoming and supportive, and I truly appreciate it._x000D_

					Although I’ve come to realise that the position isn’t quite the right fit for me, I want to thank you all for your kindness and encouragement during my time with you. I wish you all the very best in your continued success._x000D_
_x000D_
					If it’s possible to be paid for the days I attended, I’d be very grateful. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if there’s anything further you need from me._x000D_

				Hi Omar , _x000D_
_x000D_
				I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
				I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
				Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
				As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
				Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

			Hi Omar , _x000D_
_x000D_
			I hope you're well._x000D_
_x000D_
			I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
_x000D_
			Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
_x000D_
			As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
_x000D_
			Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

_x000D_

_x000D_
					I’m incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of the team – everyone has been genuinely welcoming and supportive, and I truly appreciate it._x000D_
_x000D_
					Although I’ve come to realise that the position isn’t quite the right fit for me, I want to thank you all for your kindness and encouragement during my time with you. I wish you all the very best in your continued success._x000D_
_x000D_
					If it’s possible to be paid for the days I attended, I’d be very grateful. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if there’s anything further you need from me._x000D_
_x000D_
					Thank you once again for everything._x000D_

		Hi Omar , _x000D_
		I hope you're well._x000D_
		I wanted to clarify the details regarding your attendance during the trial period for the Service Advisor role. You had previously mentioned a total of 9.5 days, however, please note that Monday, April 21st (Easter Monday) was a public holiday and therefore a day off during your trial ._x000D_
		Taking this into account, your actual attendance totals 8.5 days, which corresponds to 68.5 hours worked in total._x000D_
		As discussed, payment will be made on an hourly basis at the current minimum wage rate of £12.21 per hour, resulting in a total payment of £836.38._x000D_
		Please let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further clarification._x000D_

				Good evening Ishani and Heba,_x000D_

				I have spoken to Bruce regarding my time here at GVE London, and after careful consideration I have decided to step away from the role following my trial period. _x000D_
_x000D_
				 _x000D_
_x000D_
				I’m incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of the team – everyone has been genuinely welcoming and supportive, and I truly appreciate it._x000D_
_x000D_
				Although I’ve come to realise that the position isn’t quite the right fit for me, I want to thank you all for your kindness and encouragement during my time with you. I wish you all the very best in your continued success._x000D_
_x000D_
				If it’s possible to be paid for the days I attended, I’d be very grateful. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if there’s anything further you need from me._x000D_
_x000D_
				Thank you once again for everything._x000D_
