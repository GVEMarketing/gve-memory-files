Rowan Khan discussed his current role managing plumbers and delivering goods, expressing interest in a sales position involving supercars. He highlighted his familiarity with supercar models and the purchasing process, comparing it to his experience in calling suppliers for his business. Rowan emphasized his preference for a base salary over a commission-only role due to family commitments. He acknowledged the potential long commute from Cambridge to Uxbridge but expressed willingness to make it for the right opportunity. Rowan's salary expectations are around £32,000, understanding a potential decrease for a commission-based role. The interviewer will follow up by Friday. _x000D_
