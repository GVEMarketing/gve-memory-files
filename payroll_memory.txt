Body:
Dear George,_x000D_
_x000D_
I hope you're doing well._x000D_
_x000D_
I wanted to clarify that I always mention the salary range to candidates before scheduling interviews, as this transparency is important from the start. This is also one of the reasons why the hiring process becomes challenging, as many candidates reject the interview invites based on the salary range, something I keep you updated on regularly._x000D_
_x000D_
In addition, the salary range is clearly highlighted on the job posting itself, which should ideally set expectations. However, despite this, candidates often try to negotiate the salary and I guess this is what we are going through now._x000D_
_x000D_
I always ensure to keep both you and Ishani in the loop, so you’re aware of everything and can be kept up to date with the process. Please note that I am making every effort to follow the guidelines and communicate regularly through all steps of the process._x000D_

Hi Ishani._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for sending this over._x000D_
_x000D_
After looking at the offer and numbers I have thought about it, I need to move into a job with a basic salary + commission, I have other options at the moment, this role is attractive but I am looking for 30k + base salary plus Commission bonuses. _x000D_
_x000D_
I understand if this is not achievable but I will make the suggestion non the less._x000D_
_x000D_
Many thanks, _x000D_

If you would be willing to offer 30K + base and perhaps an amended commission structure I would be willing to accept. _x000D_
As mentioned before I just need a base pay to cover my life style and bills. _x000D_
_x000D_
Please let me know if this can be negotiated._x000D_

Good afternoon Heba and Ishani,_x000D_
_x000D_
I hope you are both well._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you Ishani for your time at the interview, it was lovely to meet you. _x000D_
_x000D_
I have already have other commitments another on Tuesday 28th January which clash with your proposed date for a trial._x000D_
_x000D_
Apologies, although I am happy to undergo a trial, there was no mention of a trial in the interview, similarly no mention this role being a wholesale focused position in the job advert/description. _x000D_
_x000D_
I am still very interested in this position but could you kindly share more information on the points below before we move any further:_x000D_
1. Will this be more of a field based role if the focus is on wholesale? If so, are all travel expenditures covered?_x000D_
2. Could you kindly share more information about the commission structure so I could forecast what my earning potential would genuinely be._x000D_
3. Seeing as the basic salary of £20,000.00 is much lower than the industry average, are there any other benefits or perks apart from the listed company pension scheme?_x000D_
4. Is there a company mobile or laptop provided so I need to create a presentation to win over clients?_x000D_
5. Are there any more steps in this interview process that I should be made aware of in advance?_x000D_
_x000D_
I look forward to hearing back and hopefully organising an alternative date for a trial._x000D_

	Good afternoon Heba and Ishani,_x000D_
_x000D_
	I hope you are both well._x000D_
_x000D_
	Thank you Ishani for your time at the interview, it was lovely to meet you. _x000D_
_x000D_
	I have already have other commitments another on Tuesday 28th January which clash with your proposed date for a trial._x000D_
_x000D_
	Apologies, although I am happy to undergo a trial, there was no mention of a trial in the interview, similarly no mention this role being a wholesale focused position in the job advert/description. _x000D_
_x000D_
	I am still very interested in this position but could you kindly share more information on the points below before we move any further:_x000D_
	1. Will this be more of a field based role if the focus is on wholesale? If so, are all travel expenditures covered?_x000D_
	2. Could you kindly share more information about the commission structure so I could forecast what my earning potential would genuinely be._x000D_
	3. Seeing as the basic salary of £20,000.00 is much lower than the industry average, are there any other benefits or perks apart from the listed company pension scheme?_x000D_
	4. Is there a company mobile or laptop provided so I need to create a presentation to win over clients?_x000D_
	5. Are there any more steps in this interview process that I should be made aware of in advance?_x000D_
_x000D_
	I look forward to hearing back and hopefully organising an alternative date for a trial._x000D_

If there had been a fair warning prior to Marc-Olivier ( the last policy) being taken out that you would back track on your statement to pay fees this situation would've been more palatable and more professional. Marc's policy was set up 2 weeks ago. _x000D_
_x000D_
We had agreed on 25% commissions on each deal completed. The goal posts have been moved with no balanced reason and this doesn't sit well with me._x000D_
_x000D_
I have been waiting for a document to arrive via email so a Director can sign it off,  to date this document has not materialised, some months after you had agreed to take us on and to pay commission. I have received the email outlining the commission structure below, but surely an email with the document which requires signing is more logical to hold a call. The email you had sent in November appears comprehensible enough. _x000D_
_x000D_
I have called into your business many times to discuss matters with you to not get called back - emailing being your preferred method of contact. Inline with my expectation of this discussed document appearing in the past weeks._x000D_
_x000D_
As this miss understanding has happened within your group all commission should still be upheld by forms of decency to your word. _x000D_
_x000D_
However, if Senior Management have made the discretionary decision to not pay, then I can't see further working relationship. _x000D_
_x000D_
We are enjoying the start of a very busy season with circa 50 monthly deals being done so we will work with the other brokers on our books instead of making Nowell & Richards our preferred partner._x000D_

Hi George, _x000D_
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on the candidate Gaurav Dadi , who has applied for the Parts Advisor position. We have yet to find any other candidates who are as suitable for the role, so I’d really appreciate if you could urgently check with David regarding his expected salary details ._x000D_
In the meantime, we will continue looking for other qualified candidates and will keep you updated on our progress._x000D_

Hi George, _x000D_
_x000D_
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on the candidate Gaurav Dadi , who has applied for the Parts Advisor position. We have yet to find any other candidates who are as suitable for the role, so I’d really appreciate if you could urgently check with David regarding his expected salary details ._x000D_
_x000D_
In the meantime, we will continue looking for other qualified candidates and will keep you updated on our progress._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for your attention to this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts._x000D_

Morning Ishani,_x000D_
Roman Gold worked the 28th Feb last month, but as he would have been going over his aloud time to work 20 hours a week._x000D_
We decided he wouldn’t clock in and could push those hours into this month._x000D_
Going over his hours each week breaches his VISA conditions, we needed him in that day so was fine to push the hours into March._x000D_
Could you do a manual adjustment to say he signed in for 8 hours on any other day this Monti_x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
As discussed over the phone, please can you remove all the deductions from Roman Gold’s payslip as he is not paying any taxes or making NI or NEST contributions since he is a student. He is really frustrated and complained me that everytime there is some kind of discrepancy in his pay/payslip. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Can you please adjust his number of hours as 31.25 at the rate of 22.50 including 28/03 working hours._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_

Dear Ishani_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I hope this email finds you well. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We are writing to inform you about some upcoming changes that will affect the pricing of your services which are completely outside of our control. While we understand that any increase in costs is never welcome, we want to be fully transparent about the reasons behind these adjustments._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
1.	3CX Licence Costs: 3CX has announced an increase in their licence costs. As a result, this will reflect in the pricing for licences across our services._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The updated 3CX System pricing details are as follows:_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Previous Price_x000D_
_x000D_
New Price_x000D_
_x000D_
£27.50 Monthly (£330 Yearly)_x000D_
_x000D_
£32.08 (£385 Yearly)_x000D_
_x000D_
Pricing Excludes VAT_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Please note that in 2023, 3CX provided a brief license extension free of charge due to a security issue, causing misaligned invoice and renewal dates. During this year’s Invoice and Renewal Dates, costs have increased. Therefore, we will invoice the difference in price accordingly now. From next year, invoices will be issued 45 days before renewal dates to ensure alignment._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Please rest assured that these increases have not been imposed by Jansa IT. The changes are entirely driven by external factors beyond our control. If we could avoid passing on these costs, we absolutely would. Our commitment to providing you with high-quality, reliable services remains unwavering, and we will continue to strive for excellent value despite these adjustments._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
If you have any questions or would like to discuss how these changes might affect your account, please don't hesitate to reach out. Our team is here to support you in every way possible._x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
As discussed over the phone, please can you remove all the deductions from Roman Gold’s payslip as he is not paying any taxes or making NI or NEST contributions since he is a student. He is really frustrated and complained me that everytime there is some kind of discrepancy in his pay/payslip._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Can you please adjust his number of hours as 31.25 at the rate of 22.50 including 28/03 working hours._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_

Hi  George,_x000D_
_x000D_
Ishani has informed me that the candidate Zakaria Raissi  mentioned that he was unsure  about the role and salary details. However, I had clearly explained from the start that we were reaching out regarding the Sales Executive position. I also clarified the base salary scale during our conversation to ensure transparency, as we usually do with all candidates._x000D_
Please let me know if you'd like me to follow up further or provide any additional information._x000D_
And also kindly provide us with your feedback regarding his interview and whether you would like to invite Zakaria for a trial day._x000D_

HI Heba, _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Thanks for this, ok understand, he seemed to think the salary started at £35K. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
The Range is £20,000-£35,000K realistically. Plus coms. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
He was still thinking he would be selling vehicles from the showroom as well. Seems like he didn’t pay much attention to your phone call then. Which is not a good sign. _x000D_

Otherwise I thought he showed energy and a willingness to develop and learn, but very little real experience as is very young. But seems an ambitious young guy. _x000D_

Hi  George,_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Ishani has informed me that the candidate Zakaria Raissi  mentioned that he was unsure  about the role and salary details. However, I had clearly explained from the start that we were reaching out regarding the Sales Executive position. I also clarified the base salary scale during our conversation to ensure transparency, as we usually do with all candidates._x000D_
_x000D_
Please let me know if you'd like me to follow up further or provide any additional information._x000D_
_x000D_
And also kindly provide us with your feedback regarding his interview and whether you would like to invite Zakaria for a trial day._x000D_
_x000D_
Best regards,_x000D_

The other four were not suitable due to various reasons, including long commuting times, misalignment in salary expectations, or incompatibility with the job type._x000D_

I’m writing to kindly request a wage advance of £200, to be deducted from my salary at the end of the month. Unfortunately, due to the consistent delays in receiving my wages over the past few months, I’ve found myself in a particularly difficult financial situation._x000D_
_x000D_
At the moment, I do not have sufficient funds to fuel my car or purchase essential groceries. My car insurance has already been cancelled twice due to missed payments, forcing me to take out a new, more expensive policy that has placed additional strain on my finances. Alongside this, the accumulation of late fees has made it even harder to recover._x000D_
_x000D_
I fully understand that this is not a standard request, but I would be sincerely grateful for any support the company can provide during this challenging time. I have also contacted George about this but have not received a response. HR have advised me to reach out to you directly, as they indicated that you would be able to assist in arranging this._x000D_

Please let me know if this is possible or if you require any additional information from my side._x000D_

Subject: Sales Executive Commission Structure

Body:
Hi Hriday,_x000D_
I hope you're doing well._x000D_
As I'm currently reviewing the commission structure for the new Sales Executive role, I want to ensure I have a complete understanding before moving forward with the candidate I will send the offer letter shortly . I've reviewed the attached commission structure sheet, but I’d appreciate it if you could provide further clarification on a few points._x000D_
Specifically, I’d like to understand:_x000D_
_x000D_
*	_x000D_
	How the commission tiers are structured and what triggers each level._x000D_
*	_x000D_
	Any performance thresholds, ceilings, or exceptions in place._x000D_
*	_x000D_
	The timeline and frequency for commission payouts._x000D_
*	_x000D_
	And importantly, whether there have been any recent updates or planned revisions to the commission rates listed in the sheet._x000D_
_x000D_
If you can include any practical examples or scenarios to illustrate how this applies in real terms, that would be really helpful as well._x000D_
Thanks in advance for your support!_x000D_
Best regards,_x000D_

Body:
Also note I have added in a couple of the outstanding issues I spoke with David about following the deductions last months the additional 5% on repeat business and the complaints David mentioned may have been from BOTB seem to be all related to servicing issue not to Detailing so from last month have included this into this month as well. _x000D_
_x000D_

That’s no problem, I have a few jobs I’ve missed out anyway and that I need to add on as they’re being paid out today so still falling into this month’s commission. You can dismiss this sheet as its inaccurate. Will send an updated one across. _x000D_

Hi Anish, _x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
That’s no problem, I have a few jobs I’ve missed out anyway and that I need to add on as they’re being paid out today so still falling into this month’s commission. You can dismiss this sheet as its inaccurate. Will send an updated one across. _x000D_

Hi Anish, _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
That’s no problem, I have a few jobs I’ve missed out anyway and that I need to add on as they’re being paid out today so still falling into this month’s commission. You can dismiss this sheet as its inaccurate. Will send an updated one across. _x000D_

Hi Team,_x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
Please note that I went through George foot Comm, all the invoices highlighted in red were raised and paid in May, I am not sure if it is does work like this normally so that is why I did not remove any of them I have just kept them highlighted. I have texted David but no response to know if we need to keep them for this month or remove them and move them to next month commission (May comm). Could you please check with previous commissions?_x000D_

Dear Ishani,_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
This is a friendly reminder that I haven't received my May salary yet. The payment was due on the last working day of the month (30/05/2025). I am not aware of any outstanding issues or reasons for non-payment. _x000D_

_x000D_
As discussed previously i am coming for work because to help my family expenses even physically and mentally am struggling to come for work._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
As requested many times still i didn't receive my March 2025 Maternity statutory pay too._x000D_

So I would like to respectfully ask you to make my March 2025 Maternity statutory pay  and May 2025 payment as soon as possible._x000D_

I have reviewed and summarized the meeting for Mustafa’s appraisal, and I have completed the basic details in the appraisal form. However, I was unable to fill out the rest of the form. I would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed with completing the form, as I believe it may require specific insights from the meeting._x000D_

After looking at the offer and numbers I have thought about it, I need to move into a job with a basic salary + commission, I have other options at the moment, this role is attractive but I am looking for 30k + base salary plus Commission bonuses. _x000D_
_x000D_
I understand if this is not achievable but I will make the suggestion non the less._x000D_

Hi Ishani._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for sending this over._x000D_
_x000D_
After looking at the offer and numbers I have thought about it, I need to move into a job with a basic salary + commission, I have other options at the moment, this role is attractive but I am looking for 30k + base salary plus Commission bonuses. _x000D_
_x000D_
I understand if this is not achievable but I will make the suggestion non the less._x000D_
_x000D_
Many thanks, _x000D_
Tom_x000D_

Dear Tom,_x000D_

 _x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you for getting back to us and for your interest in the role at GVE London. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We appreciate the time and effort you have put into considering this opportunity, and we understand the importance of finding a compensation package that aligns with your financial needs. As mentioned in the offer letter, this role is structured on a commission-only basis, and unfortunately, we are unable to offer a base salary at this time. While we recognize that a base salary provides stability, our commission-based structure is designed to reward high performance and offers significant earning potential based on sales success._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We completely respect your position and understand if this arrangement does not align with your current requirements. We sincerely appreciate your engagement throughout this process and wish you the very best in finding a role that suits your expectations._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Should your circumstances change in the future or if you wish to explore other opportunities with us, please don’t hesitate to reach out._x000D_
_x000D_

_x000D_
Wishing you the best of luck in your job search and future career._x000D_

Body:
Dear Rohith,_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
As discussed, please note the following discrepancies occurred last Friday during the payroll process._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
1.	Anujan’s overtime rate was incorrect _x000D_
2.	James commission adjustment for last month was not added (James has sent both via email)_x000D_
3.	Saad’s commission was not added (Saad has confirmed the amount via email)_x000D_
4.	Roman Gold’s hourly rate was rate for the second time and his number of hours were incorrect as well_x000D_
5.	George bank account details were incorrect. Please save the correct details _x000D_
6.	Two days salary was deducted from Grzegorz’s pay without any confirmation from HR_x000D_
7.	There was additional tax deduction from Ishani’s pay. Please check how it appeared since it would have been the case for someone else._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Please check why some of the data updated in Xero was not reflecting in this month’s payroll to avoid repetition. Let’s streamline the process to avoid unnecessary stress last minute and to avoid errors._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Let me know if you need further support from my end._x000D_

Please can you check on the attached overdue NEST contributions. I remember you mentioned that it popped up while generating the payslips._x000D_

There should be an option in Xero to update that. Meanwhile I will check with the authority how to settle the due payments for now._x000D_

Dear Team,_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I logged in to the NEST portal and it appears to be that following amounts are overdue._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
2,143.52 is overdue for GVE Detailing_x000D_
_x000D_
£834.07 is overdue for GVE Servicing_x000D_
_x000D_
£3013.94 is overdue for GVE London_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
This is supposed to be direct debit, therefore please check why it has not gone through. Technically this should be paid before 10the of each month._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
It seems you can confirm the schedule and make the bank payment straight away._x000D_

I logged in to the NEST portal and it appears to be that following amounts are overdue._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
2,143.52 is overdue for GVE Detailing_x000D_

_x000D_
£3013.94 is overdue for GVE London_x000D_

If there had been a fair warning prior to Marc-Olivier ( the last policy) being taken out that you would back track on your statement to pay fees this situation would've been more palatable and more professional. Marc's policy was set up 2 weeks ago. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We had agreed on 25% commissions on each deal completed. The goal posts have been moved with no balanced reason and this doesn't sit well with me._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I have been waiting for a document to arrive via email so a Director can sign it off,  to date this document has not materialised, some months after you had agreed to take us on and to pay commission. I have received the email outlining the commission structure below, but surely an email with the document which requires signing is more logical to hold a call. The email you had sent in November appears comprehensible enough. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I have called into your business many times to discuss matters with you to not get called back - emailing being your preferred method of contact. Inline with my expectation of this discussed document appearing in the past weeks._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
As this miss understanding has happened within your group all commission should still be upheld by forms of decency to your word. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
However, if Senior Management have made the discretionary decision to not pay, then I can't see further working relationship. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We are enjoying the start of a very busy season with circa 50 monthly deals being done so we will work with the other brokers on our books instead of making Nowell & Richards our preferred partner._x000D_

Morning Ishani,_x000D_
_x000D_
Roman Gold worked the 28th Feb last month, but as he would have been going over his aloud time to work 20 hours a week._x000D_
_x000D_
We decided he wouldn’t clock in and could push those hours into this month._x000D_
_x000D_
Going over his hours each week breaches his VISA conditions, we needed him in that day so was fine to push the hours into March._x000D_
_x000D_
Could you do a manual adjustment to say he signed in for 8 hours on any other day this Monti_x000D_

Dear Ishani_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
I hope this email finds you well. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
We are writing to inform you about some upcoming changes that will affect the pricing of your services which are completely outside of our control. While we understand that any increase in costs is never welcome, we want to be fully transparent about the reasons behind these adjustments._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
1.	3CX Licence Costs: 3CX has announced an increase in their licence costs. As a result, this will reflect in the pricing for licences across our services._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
The updated 3CX System pricing details are as follows:_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Previous Price_x000D_
_x000D_
New Price_x000D_
_x000D_
£27.50 Monthly (£330 Yearly)_x000D_
_x000D_
£32.08 (£385 Yearly)_x000D_
_x000D_
Pricing Excludes VAT_x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Please note that in 2023, 3CX provided a brief license extension free of charge due to a security issue, causing misaligned invoice and renewal dates. During this year’s Invoice and Renewal Dates, costs have increased. Therefore, we will invoice the difference in price accordingly now. From next year, invoices will be issued 45 days before renewal dates to ensure alignment._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Please rest assured that these increases have not been imposed by Jansa IT. The changes are entirely driven by external factors beyond our control. If we could avoid passing on these costs, we absolutely would. Our commitment to providing you with high-quality, reliable services remains unwavering, and we will continue to strive for excellent value despite these adjustments._x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
If you have any questions or would like to discuss how these changes might affect your account, please don't hesitate to reach out. Our team is here to support you in every way possible._x000D_

HI Ishani, _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
Nikku (Harmeet) Singh has ordered from product on account he is going to pay for. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
This is on a credit account not due for payment until next month so it should be fine for this to be deducted from his salary at the end of this month. _x000D_
_x000D_
 _x000D_
_x000D_
For the attached invoice: Total £511.20 total. _x000D_

Many thanks,_x000D_
